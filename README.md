# EZ BUDGET Monthly Financial Tool

## Overview

EZ BUDGET is an intuitive and minimal monthly budgeting web application that allows users to breakdown their monthly income into designated categories for spending, saving, and necessities.
This project was spawned from the need for an easy-to-use and intuitive budgeting tool.

## Current Features

- **Custom Percentages**: Dynamically adjust the percent of your monthly income you want to designate to the three main budget categories.
  
- **Reactive Expenses**: As the user enters expenses, the total budget gets decremented in real time so you always know how much you have left for that category.
  
- **Dark Mode**: Reduce eye strain with our beautiful dark mode.

## Getting Started

1. **Enter Projected Monthly Income**: Type in your monthly income.

2. **Create Budget**: Click the 'create budget' button to see how you can spend your money.

4. **Enter Expenses**: Enter in your monthly expenses in the appropriate category and see how it effects your total budget.
